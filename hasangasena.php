		<h4>Why We need Donations</h4>
		<p>
			This Library was established in year 2001 with the combination of Ranaviru Seva Authority 
and Sri Lanka Army. After the opening of the Ranaviru Scheme then it was treated with many 
government organizations and Non-Government Organizations because of that villagers are 
retired, medically disabled army soldiers. For use of them a Library was started in year 2001.  
From  the  beginning  for  now,  the  library  was  developed  very  slowly  by  the  donations  of 
personals. When the starting of the library there were only 50+ members and after that it has 
developed and number of members has increased to 100. That library is the only library for 3 
villages nearby and development of that library may be a good thing for that area. One reason 
is to create that type of online Library Management System is to make people more familiar 
to library and make higher the number of people who are actively using the library. Then that 
will be an encouragement for the government and non-government organizations to develop 
this library.
